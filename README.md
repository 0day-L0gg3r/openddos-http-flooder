# openddos-http-flooder
OpenDDoS is a open-source HTTP Flooder. 

OpenDDoS is based on Python.

I have tested this on many websites, 9 / 10 websites went down.

some NASA Subdomains can get downed, so to NASA, Fix your security hahahaha.

OpenDDoS requires the following Python modules to work
urllib.request, os, threading, time, random, sys

I Use OpenDDoS / OpenDoS with Python3 on a Manjaro Linux system ( based on Arch Linux )

Have fun hiting :)
